## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
test = cars
bla = 5
a <- '524ss'
# asdfsdf l;a jsd;lfkjs ad;lkj sal;kdf ;lkasdjf l;asdjf ;lckxj vozxchv pqoewrj asdplfj asc;lvh ;rly kewrj tpqoewihf asd;lkhv ;lskrjt apoweh 
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r "check-style", eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# for submission, this mus produce NO entries in the Markers tab
lintr::lint("assignment.Rmd")
```

```{r "check-compile", eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# for submission, this must run through to 100% without error
rmarkdown::render("assignment.Rmd")
```
