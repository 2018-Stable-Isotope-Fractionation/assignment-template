## Setup

1. Login: log into the RStudio Server with your username and password
2. Clone repository (with git previously configured in the [RMarkdown introduction](../assignment-rmarkdown-intro/)):
  - if you have an open project in your RStudio Server, close it by choosing **Close Project** from the **Project** dropdown button in the upper right corner (it should say `Project: (None)` afterwards)
  - at the top of this repository, click on the green **Clone or download** button and copy the shown link to the clipboard
  - in your R Server terminal (not the console), type `git clone ` and paste the copied link right after (so it says something to the effect `git clone https://github.com/......git`), then execute the command to creates a local copy of your GitHub repository (the new folder should show up in the files list on the right)
4. Load project:
 - click the **Project** dropdown button again and choose **Open Project**
 - navigate to the new project folder and select the `project.Rproj` file inside it
 - this will load a new R session rooted in the new project folder (you will see this project now selected in the **Project** dropdown)
5. Activate code checking:
 - open this file (`README.md`) in your RStudio Server and in the **Status** section below, replace each instance of `ORGANIZATION/REPOSITORY` with the **GitHub name of your classroom** `/` **name of your repository**: these are both shown in big letters at the top of the repository page on GitHub, or alternatively, can be copied from everything after `https://github.com/` in the web address of the repository main page
 - click **Preview** to confirm that you get two images for the Master and Submit branch that look like this: ![build unknown](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/travis-ci/travis-api/master/public/images/result/unknown.png)
 - commit this change to the `README.md` and push it to GitHub
 - on GitHub, you should now be able to click on the branch pictures which sends you to Travis CI: click **Sign in with GitHub** and enter your GitHub credentials to see the status of your code check. This will run after every single commit (the first time it will take 20-30 minutes, afterwards typically 2-5 minutes) and show you in red if there are problems (`build failing`) or in green if your code has run without any trouble (`build passing`).

## Status
